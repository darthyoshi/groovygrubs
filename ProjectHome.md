A backup repository for GroovyGrubs, a website for sharing recipes. Unfortunately, the original repository is no longer available, so the revision information has been lost. However, a demo of the original project can be found at http://sfsuswe.com/~f12g06. The final project documentation can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8DtqFIE221kR1l0TXR5aUtLWVU/view?usp=sharing).

The GroovyGrubs team consisted of the following members:
  * Kay Choi
  * Therese Demers
